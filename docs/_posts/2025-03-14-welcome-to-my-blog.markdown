Hi, my name is Niels and I recently started to explore astrophotography!

With this blog I want to document my endeavours, especially using analog film for astrophotography.
Since I'm new to this, the first posts will be mostly tied to my learning steps.

Once I perform the first actual tests, the results will be added as well.
